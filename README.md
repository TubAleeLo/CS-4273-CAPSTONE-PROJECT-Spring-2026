## Project Description
This portion of the project is focuesd in lowering the barrier for social science researchers to work with large-scale social media data. Some of these social science researchers lack the programming or data engineering skills required to prepare datasets for qualitative or quantitaticce analysis. This project bulids a **no-code**, **AI-assisted platform** that transforms unstructured social media posts into structred reasearch-ready datasets.

The system uses **agentic AI** to **automate data cleaning, deduplication, topic fultering, and early-stage qualitative exploration**, while keeping the reasercher fully in control through by allowing them to **review and fine tune** as they use this system.

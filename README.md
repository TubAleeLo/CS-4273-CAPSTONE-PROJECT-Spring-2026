# CS-4273-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-Spring-2026 Group K

## Project Description

This project focuses in lowering the barrier for social science researchers to work with large-scale social media data. Some of these social science researchers lack the programming or data engineering skills required to prepare datasets for qualitative or quantitaticce analysis. This project bulids a **no-code**, **AI-assisted platform** that transforms unstructured social media posts into structred reasearch-ready datasets.

The system uses **agentic AI** to **automate data cleaning, deduplication, topic fultering, and early-stage qualitative exploration**, while keeping the reasercher fully in control through by allowing them to **review and fine tune** as they use this system.

### Problem Motivation

Social media data (Reddit, YouTube, Twitter/X, app reviews, etc.) is increasingly essential for research on public opinion, communication, and social behavior.

However, before meaningful analysis can occur, researchers must perform:

1. Merging different data sources

2. Cleaning noisy or irrelevant posts

3. Deduplicating large collections

4. Topic- or keyword-based filtering

5. Converting unstructured text into structured formats

These steps are **time-consuming and highly technical, often requiring coding, APIs, or familiarity with machine learning pipelines**. Consequently, many non-technical researchers either **avoid using large-scale datasets or rely on ad-hoc, manual workflows**.

### Project Goal

Build a prototype no-code platform that enables non-technical users to:

- Upload social media datasets

- Clean and organize raw text

- Filter content using natural-language topic descriptions

- Discover themes through automated clustering

- Collaboratively annotate and validate results

- Export structured datasets for downstream analysis (Sister Group)

### Objectives

1. Lower Technical Barriers
    Enable social scientists to work with large-scale datasets without writing code.

2. Automate Early-Stage Data Preparation
   Use LLMs and existing NLP pipelines to automate cleaning, deduplication, filtering, and extraction.

3. Support Qualitative Exploration
   Provide capabilities for topic discovery (e.g., BERTopic, embeddings-based clustering).

4. Human-in-the-Loop Annotation
   Allow researchers to refine, validate, and label discovered themes.

5. Output Analysis-Ready Data
   Generate standardized structured outputs to be consumed directly by Project 2’s autonomous data analysis agent.
